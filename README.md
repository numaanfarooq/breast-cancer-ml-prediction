Breast Cancer Prediction Project


Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases affecting women worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), breast cancer is the most common cancer among women globally, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in 2020 alone. Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. By using machine learning techniques, we seek to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis and improve patient care.

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of breast cancer in individuals based on demographic and clinical characteristics. By using machine learning algorithms, we seek to create a predictive model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, thereby improving patient care and outcomes.


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains clinical features extracted from digitized images of breast mass fine needle aspirates (FNA), along with labels indicating whether the masses are malignant or benign. The dataset includes the following variables:


Age: Age of the individuals in years.
BMI (Body Mass Index): Measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Glucose: Glucose levels in the blood, measured in mg/dL.
Insulin: Insulin levels in the blood, measured in µU/mL.
HOMA (Homeostatic Model Assessment): Method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function.
Leptin: Hormone that regulates energy balance and inhibits hunger, measured in ng/mL.
Adiponectin: Protein hormone involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid breakdown, measured in µU/mL.
Resistin: Hormone secreted by adipose tissue involved in insulin resistance, measured in ng/mL.
MCP.1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1): Protein involved in the recruitment of monocytes to sites of inflammation, measured in pg/dL.
Classification (Target): Binary variable indicating whether an individual is a healthy control (1) or a patient with breast cancer (2).
